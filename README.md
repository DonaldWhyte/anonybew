Anonybew is a fork of Mibew Messenger, an open-source live support
application written in PHP and MySQL. Mibew enables one-on-one chat
assistance in real-time directly from your website.

Anonybew does not permanently log conversations or associate an
identity (i.e. user) to messages. Additionally, the IP addresses
are not traced. These three changes anonymise the service so
users chatting on the system do not have to worry about their
conversations being recorded.
